# CSC3100 – Data Structures  
### Coursework Portfolio by *Yeraly Kaimolda*

This repository contains the programming assignments, reports, and implementations I completed in **CSC3100 – Data Structures** at CUHK-Shenzhen.

Throughout this course, I learned how to design, analyse, and optimize classical data structures and algorithms.  
The work here demonstrates my ability to:

- Organize data efficiently  
- Reason about time & space complexity  
- Model real-world problems with appropriate data structures  
- Choose and implement the right structure for each task (heaps, trees, hash tables, graphs, etc.)  
- Build and optimize my own implementations instead of relying only on library classes

## 📚 Course Topics Covered

This repository reflects my work and understanding of the major topics taught in CSC3100, including:

### **Sorting & Complexity**
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quicksort  
- Other comparison-based sorting algorithms  
- Asymptotic notation (Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ)  
- Divide-and-Conquer complexity analysis  

### **Linear Structures**
- Lists (array-based & linked lists)  
- Stacks  
- Queues  

### **Trees**
- Binary Trees  
- Binary Search Trees (BST)  
- AVL Trees  
- Red-Black Trees  

### **Advanced Data Structures**
- Heaps (MaxHeap / MinHeap, including custom implementations)  
- Hash Tables & Hashing  

### **Graphs**
- Graph representation (e.g., adjacency lists)  
- BFS & DFS  
- Cycle detection in directed graphs (3-colour DFS)  
- Minimum Spanning Trees (Prim, Kruskal, Manhattan-distance MST)  
- Shortest Path algorithms

## 🧪 Coursework Included

Each folder in this repository corresponds to one major assignment in the course.

### **A1 – Optimization Problems**
- Binary search on the answer  
- Range and bottleneck calculations  
- Custom Mersenne Twister random generator (for P2)

### **A2 – Data-Structure-Based Problem Solving**
- Subarray scanning with pruning  
- Set splitting via hashing  
- Dictionary-based dynamic grouping systems  

### **A3 – Advanced Structures**
- **Cancer Cells** — Max-Heap simulation with a custom priority queue  
- **Irminsul’s Memory Network** — Tree / graph traversal and path computation using BFS  

### **A4 – Graph Algorithms (DFS & MST)**
- **Spell Dependency Checker** — Directed graph modelling of spell prerequisites with DFS and 3-colour marking to detect cycles (decides whether the spell system is consistent or not)  
- **Mana Crystal Network MST** — Minimum Spanning Tree construction (e.g., Prim’s algorithm with a hand-written MinHeap) for a weighted network, including Manhattan-distance style edge costs  

These assignments required not only implementing data structures, but also **justifying and selecting the most efficient approach** for each scenario.

## 🧠 What I Learned

By completing all four assignments, I gained proficiency in:

- Implementing **my own** data structures (custom heaps, queues, lists, hash tables)  
- Understanding **when** to use which structure for best performance  
- Modelling practical problems as graphs and applying BFS/DFS and MST algorithms  
- Detecting cycles in directed graphs using DFS with white/grey/black node colouring  
- Designing a custom MinHeap that supports efficient key updates (`decreaseKey`) when Java’s `PriorityQueue` is not sufficient  
- Optimizing algorithms under strict time and memory constraints  
- Avoiding unnecessary recomputation and redundant work  
- Writing clean, readable, and well-structured Java code for algorithms  

Overall, this repository represents my **end-to-end understanding of data-structure design and optimization** across the CSC3100 curriculum.
