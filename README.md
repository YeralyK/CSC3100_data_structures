# CSC3100 – Data Structures  
### Coursework Portfolio by *[Yeraly Kaimolda]*

This repository contains all programming assignments, reports, and implementations I completed in **CSC3100 – Data Structures** at CUHK-Shenzhen.

Throughout this course, I learned how to design, analyse, and optimize classical data structures and algorithms.  
All work here demonstrates my understanding of:

- Efficient data organization  
- Time & space complexity optimization  
- Real-world problem solving using proper data structures  
- Choosing the right structure for each task (heap, tree, hash, graph, etc.)

## 📚 Course Topics Covered

This repository reflects my work and understanding of all major topics taught in CSC3100, including:

### **Sorting & Complexity**
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quicksort  
- More sorting algorithms  
- Asymptotic notation (Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ)  
- Divide-and-Conquer complexity analysis  

### **Linear Structures**
- Lists (array-based & linked lists)  
- Stacks  
- Queues  

### **Trees**
- Binary Trees  
- Binary Search Trees (BST)  
- AVL Trees  
- Red-Black Trees  

### **Advanced Data Structures**
- Heaps (MaxHeap / MinHeap)  
- Hash Tables & Hashing  

### **Graphs**
- BFS & DFS  
- Minimum Spanning Trees

## 🧪 Coursework Included

Each folder in this repository corresponds to one major assignment in the course.

### **A1 – Optimization Problems**
- Binary search on the answer  
- Range and bottleneck calculations  
- Custom Mersenne Twister random generator (for P2)

### **A2 – Data-Structure Based Problem Solving**
- Subarray scanning with pruning  
- Set splitting via hashing  
- Dictionary-based dynamic grouping systems  

### **A3 – Advanced Structures**
- **Cancer Cells** — Max-Heap simulation with custom priority queue  
- **Irminsul’s Memory Network** — Tree BFS all-pairs path computation

These assignments required not only implementing data structures, but choosing the **most optimal** one for each scenario.

## 🧠 What I Learned

By completing all assignments, I gained proficiency in:

- Implementing **my own** data structures (custom heaps, queues, lists)
- Understanding **when** to use which structure  
- Optimizing algorithms under time constraints  
- Avoiding unnecessary recomputation  
- Writing clean, efficient, well-structured code  
- Applying BFS/DFS on real tasks  
- Using hashing and sets to handle dynamic groups  
- Using priority queues for simulation and extraction tasks

This repository represents my **full understanding of data-structure optimization** across the entire CSC3100 curriculum.
